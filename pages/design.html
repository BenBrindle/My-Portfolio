        <section class='design-process'>
            <h2>Define</h2>
            <p>
                The first step in the process is to define the product. This is the foundation on top of which I can
                start building, this helps me understand the context of the product and itâ€™s reason for existence.
                This step will usually start with a meeting with the stakeholder and the design team to discuss the
                scope of the product. This is also a good opportunity to start requirements gathering.
            </p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                After defining the product I will then start to gather research. This can be done in a number of
                ways.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Surveys, this is to gather a deeper understanding of an individual and their life and the way they
                make decisions and overcome challenges. This will also help me understand if the product brief needs
                to be revisited.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Focus groups, these are used to bring together a group of individuals and gain feedback on a concept
                or an idea.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Competitor information and existing literature, this is a key part of the research stage as I can
                use this to better understand the product I am designing, using already existing information on
                other similar products.
            </p>

            <h2>Analyse</h2>
            <p>
                This is where I start to understand who the user of the product is in much more detail. Using the
                information gathered in my research I can start to narrow down specific groups of individuals that
                fit my target audience and this will ultimately help me during my design.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                This stage can also be repeated after going back to the research stage and gathering more
                information once I know who the user will be.
            </p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>
                Once I have defined the user I can move onto the initial design phase.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                This may start out as a rough sketch and I may need to go back and forth with the stakeholder on
                this stage to ensure they are happy with the direction that I am going before starting a more
                concrete design. Once I have finalised the initial concept I can start to build the product out
                using low fidelity wireframes then adding more specific features as I build the product up, colours,
                imagery, buttons, this will all be added until I have a more polished concept. I can then start to
                create a working prototype which I can then use during testing.
            </p>

            <h2>Test</h2>
            <p>
                This stage is highly important as this will help me understand if the design is functional. I will
                usually start with unit testing, this could be done by myself or the design team but this is for me
                to understand if all of the functionality in the product works as it should. Once this is complete I
                can move onto creating a test case for the product. The goal of a test case is to find all possible
                situations that I may not have considered and to probe each possible way that a user may interact
                with the product to ensure I have not missed anything during unit testing. There are also a number
                of other testing methods that may be used.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Environmental testing, this could involve other browsers or devices. It could involve different
                hardware or it could even involve location.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Regression testing, this is done when adding new features to ensure that all new features that are
                added to the product go through the same rigorous methods as the rest of the product.
            </p>

            <h2>Validate</h2>
            <p>
                I will finally use the information I have gathered during my other 5 steps to start to build a
                version of the product that I can validate against the user requirements. This stage will also
                require a testing stage and may also require going back to look at some of the other stages that I
                have been through to ensure that once built it meets all of the requirements expected.
